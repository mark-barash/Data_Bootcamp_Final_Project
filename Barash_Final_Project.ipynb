Whenever I venture off into a not-so-safe neighborhood, I am rather unenthused to enter a restuarant and confidently say that I trust its sanitation compliance. This is where I got the idea to test income, and population (both by zipcode) against the number and types of restuarantviolations in those areas."

That is slightly concerning, but makes sense due to the frequency of American food spots within New York City. We can also see that Chinese food ranks next worst in sanitation as the next highest violating cuisine in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn! There is also quite a high frequency of Chinese restaurants around the city, which definitely accounts for such a high number, however provides some insight on the overall sanitation of dive chinese food in the city."
